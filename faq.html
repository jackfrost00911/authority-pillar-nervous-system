            <h3>Is this therapy or medical treatment?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>No.</strong> This is strictly educational. Therapy typically focuses on the "story" (your thoughts, history, and emotions). We focus on the "state" (your nervous system, respiration, and posture).
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                We provide mechanical frameworks for self-regulation, similar to how a personal trainer provides frameworks for physical fitness.

            <h3>Does this replace medication?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Never stop or alter your medication without consulting your doctor.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Nervous system conditioning is a "bottom-up" approach (body-to-brain), while medication and counseling are often "top-down" (brain-to-body). They can work beautifully together as complementary systems.

            <h3>How long does conditioning take?</h3>
            <p>
                The nervous system changes through <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>, which requires consistency, not intensity. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                While many users feel a state shift immediately (within 10 minutes), re-calibrating your "baseline" usually takes about 14 to 30 days of daily practice. Think of it like brushing your teeth—it works best as a daily hygiene habit.

            <h3>Why haven't I heard anxiety explained this way?</h3>
            <p>
                The medical model naturally separates the "mind" (Psychology) from the "body" (Physiology). 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Most anxiety advice assumes the problem is "Software" (your thoughts). We operate on the premise that the problem is often "Hardware" (a sensitized nervous system). This mechanical perspective is newer to the mainstream, but grounded in established polyvagal theory.
